# Schedules Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to output a table containing pairs of employees and how often they have coincided in the office. The solution consists of a single JavaScript file that reads the input file, processes the data, and generates the output.

## Approach

1. Read the input file with the schedules of each employee.
2. Parse the data into an array of objects, where each object represents an *Employee* and its *Schedule*.
3. Count the number of coincidences between each pair of employees.
4. Output the results to the console.

## Instructions

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `https://github.com/LucasCarbonari/schedules.git`
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `node main.js schedules.txt`.
4. The output will be printed to the console.

*Note: You need Node.js installed on your machine.*
